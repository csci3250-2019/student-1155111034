## **Introduction**

Hello! I am **Arthur**. You may not know how to pronouced it right? Normally I called myself **Arthur**. 
But people always said it wrong as **Arthur**. I check the dictionary to see whether **Arthur** or **Arthur** is right.
The result turns out the correct pronounciation is **Arthur**.
